# Design of Business Intelligence on Geospatial Data Using Deep Learning
## Overview
[description]

## Features
* Implements sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiment polarity from textual data such as customer reviews, social media posts, and feedback.
* Incorporates topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover latent themes and topics within textual data.
* Combines geospatial analysis with sentiment analysis and topic modeling to provide a holistic understanding of business opportunities, including customer sentiments, market trends, and geographic preferences.

## Technologies
* Python
* Natural Language Processing library (NLTK)
* Topic modeling frameworks like Gensim for implementing topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Web development frameworks (Streamlit)

## Folder Structure

- **Notebooks:** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and analysis. Each notebook is named descriptively to indicate its purpose or the stage of the analysis.

- **Model Deployment:** This folder holds files related to the development of the web application.
  
- **Presentation:** This folder contains video related to the model deployment demonstration.

- **Documentation:** This folder contains documentation file which is the research paper.
