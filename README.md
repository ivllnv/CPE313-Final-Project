# Design of Business Intelligence on Geospatial Data Using Deep Learning
## Overview
[description]

## Features
* Implements sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiment polarity from textual data such as customer reviews, social media posts, and feedback.
* Incorporates topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover latent themes and topics within textual data.
* Combines geospatial analysis with sentiment analysis and topic modeling to provide a holistic understanding of business opportunities, including customer sentiments, market trends, and geographic preferences.

## Technologies
* Python
* Natural Language Processing library (NLTK)
* Topic modeling frameworks like Gensim for implementing topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Web development frameworks (Streamlit)
