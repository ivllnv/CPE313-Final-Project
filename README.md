# Design of Business Intelligence on Geospatial Data Using Deep Learning
## Overview
This repository contains the final deliverables for the course CPE313 Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The project focuses on the design and implementation of a business opportunity analysis system using geospatial data. The goal is to develop a comprehensive framework that leverages geospatial information to identify and assess potential business opportunities in specific regions or areas of interest.

## Features
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiment polarity from textual data such as customer reviews.
* **Topic Modeling**: Incorporates topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover latent themes and topics within textual data.
* **Geospatial Analysis**: Combines geospatial analysis with sentiment analysis and topic modeling to provide a holistic understanding of business opportunities, including customer sentiments, market trends, and geographic preferences.

## Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
* Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities
* TextBlob for sentiment analysis
* Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
* Topic modeling frameworks like Gensim for implementing topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Web development frameworks (Streamlit)
